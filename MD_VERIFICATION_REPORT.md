# MD Files Verification Report

## Summary

I've verified all MD files in the Pantheon project. Here's what I found:

## Files Updated
1. **docs/implementation/MD_SYSTEM_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md** - Updated references to point to new documentation
2. **Removed gods/docs/MD_BASED_AGENTS_GUIDE.md** - Outdated, replaced by gods/README.md

## Current Documentation Structure

### ✅ Core Documentation (Up to date)
- **README.md** - Main project documentation with MD system section
- **gods/README.md** - Comprehensive MD-based agent system guide
- **docs/implementation/MD_BASED_AGENT_SYSTEM.md** - Technical architecture details
- **test-md-system.js** - Working test suite

### ✅ Implementation Docs (Valid and current)
- docs/implementation/HYBRID_ORCHESTRATION.md
- docs/implementation/HYBRID_ORCHESTRATION_SUMMARY.md
- docs/implementation/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
- docs/implementation/MD_SYSTEM_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md

### ✅ Example & Explanation Docs (Still relevant)
- docs/examples/COMPLETE_EXAMPLE.md
- docs/examples/QUICK_DEMO.md
- docs/examples/QUICKSTART.md
- docs/explanations/* - All visual explanations still valid

### ✅ God Agent Definitions (Required by system)
- gods/.claude/agents/*.md - All 16 god agent definitions used by the system

### ⚠️ Unrelated Files (Different project)
The gods/.claude/ directory contains many files from what appears to be "Pantheon v2" - a different conversational project setup system:

- gods/.claude/commands/ - 23 command files
- gods/.claude/lib/ - 11 library documentation files
- gods/.claude/templates/ - 3 template files
- gods/.claude/workflows/ - 4 workflow files
- gods/.claude/examples/, tests/ - Example and test docs
- gods/.claude/README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, GETTING_STARTED.md

These files describe a `/gods init` conversational system that's unrelated to our god agent orchestration system.

## Recommendation

Keep only the gods/.claude/agents/ directory which contains the god agent definitions. The rest of gods/.claude/ appears to be from a different project and should be removed to avoid confusion.

## Action Items
1. ✅ Updated MD_SYSTEM_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md references
2. ✅ Removed outdated MD_BASED_AGENTS_GUIDE.md
3. ⏳ Consider removing unrelated gods/.claude/ files (except agents/)
4. ✅ All other documentation is current and properly linked
