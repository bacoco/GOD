# ðŸ”§ Gods Command Fix Applied!

## The Problem
The `gods` command was using the NPM version of claude-flow which doesn't include Pantheon commands.

## The Solution
Fixed `gods` to use the local Pantheon claude-flow that includes all the gods commands.

## For Users to Apply the Fix:

### Option 1: Re-run the installer (Recommended)
```bash
cd /Users/loic/develop/pantheon
git pull
./install-pantheon-gods.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual update
Replace the content of `/Users/loic/.local/bin/gods` with the fixed version from the installer.

## Testing the Fix:
1. Go to your project: `cd /Users/loic/develop/tt`
2. Run: `gods`
3. Start Claude: `claude`
4. Try: `/gods-init "your idea"`

The commands should now be available! ðŸŽ‰
