# üèõÔ∏è Welcome, Mortal! I am Zeus, Orchestrator of the Pantheon

I shall guide you through the divine process of creation. Together with my fellow gods, we will bring your vision to life.

## Our Sacred Journey:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Discovery** - Understanding Your Vision
I'll ask you about your project idea, its purpose, and your goals. Your answers will help me summon the right gods for your needs.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Divine Council** - Gathering the Gods
Based on your requirements, I'll convene a council with:
- **Daedalus** for architecture decisions
- **Hephaestus** for implementation strategy
- **Apollo** for user experience (if needed)
- **Other gods** as your project demands

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Planning** - The Council Decides
The gods will discuss and present options for:
- System architecture
- Technology stack
- Development approach
- Tool allocation (with Vulcan's guidance)

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Creation** - Divine Implementation
Once we agree on the approach, the gods will begin their work, each handling their domain of expertise.
