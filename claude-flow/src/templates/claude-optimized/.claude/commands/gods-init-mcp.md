# 🏛️ Welcome to Pantheon

I'll help you start a new project by connecting you with Zeus and the divine pantheon of AI gods. Each god specializes in different aspects of software creation.

## Prerequisites

Make sure the Pantheon MCP server is running:
```bash
# In your terminal (not here):
cd /path/to/pantheon
node pantheon-mcp-server.js
```

## How This Works

1. You describe your project idea
2. Zeus will ask clarifying questions
3. Other gods join as needed (Apollo for design, Hephaestus for backend, etc.)
4. Together, we'll plan and build your project

## The Gods Available

- **Zeus** ⚡ - Project orchestration and coordination
- **Apollo** ☀️ - UI/UX design and user experience  
- **Hephaestus** 🔨 - Backend development and APIs
- **Athena** 🦉 - Strategic analysis and AI features
- **Daedalus** 📐 - System architecture
- **Themis** ⚖️ - Testing and quality assurance
- And many more specialists!
