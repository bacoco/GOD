# üèõÔ∏è Pantheon - Your Divine AI Council

Transform your ideas into reality through natural conversation with a council of specialized AI gods. No coding required.

## What is Pantheon?

Pantheon is your personal team of AI specialists, each a master of their domain:

- **Zeus** orchestrates your entire project
- **Prometheus** shapes your product vision  
- **Apollo** creates stunning designs
- **Hephaestus** builds with master craftsmanship
- **And 14 more specialists** ready to help

You simply describe what you want to create. The gods handle everything else.

## Start Your Journey

```
/gods init "I want to create a meditation app"
```

That's all. Zeus will greet you and guide you through a natural conversation to bring your vision to life.

## How It Works

1. **Share Your Idea** - Tell the gods what you want to create
2. **Have a Conversation** - They ask questions to understand your vision
3. **Collaborate Naturally** - Different gods join as needed
4. **Watch It Happen** - Your idea transforms into reality

No technical knowledge needed. No code to write. Just natural conversation.

## Example Journey

```
You: /gods init "I need a website for my bakery"

[Zeus]: Greetings! A bakery website - how delightful. To create 
something perfect for your business, tell me: what's most important 
for your customers to find on your site?

You: Our daily specials and online ordering

[Zeus]: Perfect! I can see this requires both beautiful presentation 
and smooth functionality. Let me bring in Prometheus to help define 
these features in detail...

[Prometheus]: Thank you, Zeus. A bakery with daily specials and online 
ordering - this excites me! Let's explore: do you bake everything 
fresh daily, or do some items require advance ordering?
```

The conversation continues naturally until your vision is complete.

## The Divine Council

Each god brings unique expertise:

- **Product & Strategy**: Prometheus, Athena
