# üèõÔ∏è Pantheon - Your Divine AI Council

Transform your ideas into reality through natural conversation with a council of specialized AI gods. No coding required.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pantheon.git
cd pantheon

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start creating with the gods
node claude-pantheon.js "/gods init 'I want to build a task tracker'"
```

## What is Pantheon?

Pantheon is your personal team of AI specialists, each a master of their domain:

- **Zeus** orchestrates your entire project
- **Prometheus** shapes your product vision  
- **Apollo** creates stunning designs
- **Hephaestus** builds with master craftsmanship
- **And 14 more specialists** ready to help

You simply describe what you want to create. The gods handle everything else.

## Start Your Journey

To use Pantheon with Claude Code CLI, run:

```bash
# Start a new project with conversational guidance
node claude-pantheon.js "/gods init 'I want to create a meditation app'"

# Or simply run help to see all commands
node claude-pantheon.js "/gods help"
```

Zeus will greet you and guide you through a natural conversation to bring your vision to life.

## How It Works

1. **Share Your Idea** - Tell the gods what you want to create
2. **Have a Conversation** - They ask questions to understand your vision
3. **Collaborate Naturally** - Different gods join as needed
4. **Watch It Happen** - Your idea transforms into reality

No technical knowledge needed. No code to write. Just natural conversation.

## Example Journey

Run the command:
```bash
node claude-pantheon.js "/gods init 'I need a website for my bakery'"
```

The conversation begins:
```
[Zeus]: Greetings! I am Zeus, orchestrator of the Pantheon. I'm here to 
understand your vision and guide you through bringing it to life. I need 
a website for my bakery - what an intriguing vision! To ensure we create 
exactly what you imagine, I'd like to understand a few things:

‚Ä¢ Who do you envision as the primary users of this?
‚Ä¢ What single feature would make this indispensable?
‚Ä¢ Is there a particular feeling or experience you want users to have?

Share your thoughts freely - there are no wrong answers.

You: Our local customers who want to see daily specials and place orders

[Zeus]: Perfect! I can see this requires both beautiful presentation 
and smooth functionality. Let me bring in Prometheus to help define 
these features in detail...

[Prometheus]: Thank you, Zeus. I'm Prometheus, and I specialize in 
transforming visions into concrete features. Based on what you discussed 
with Zeus, I'm thinking about user profiles, recipe collections, and 
interactive cooking modes. What feature would make your platform 
indispensable to users?
```

The conversation continues naturally until your vision is complete and Hephaestus generates your project!
