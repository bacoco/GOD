## ðŸ“Š Simple Task Flow (Score â‰¤ 5)

```
User: "Create a login endpoint"
         â”‚
         â–¼
Claude-Flow: "Hey Pantheon plugin, handle this!"
         â”‚
         â–¼
Pantheon: "Summoning Zeus..."
         â”‚
         â–¼
Zeus.js: "Let me analyze... Score = 3 (simple!)"
         "I'll handle this myself in JavaScript"
         "Hey Hephaestus.js, make a login endpoint!"
         â”‚
         â–¼
Hephaestus.js: "Done! Here's your endpoint"
         â”‚
         â–¼
User: "Thanks!" âœ…

WHO CREATED AGENTS: Only Zeus.js created Hephaestus.js
WHEN: Immediately, because task was simple
HOW: Direct JavaScript call, no AI involved

                          Apollo (JS+AI)

WHO CREATED AGENTS: 
- Zeus.js created Zeus AI
- Zeus AI created Daedalus, Hephaestus, Apollo (using Task tool)
- Claude-Flow actually spawns them when Task is called

WHEN: When complexity > 5
HOW: Through Claude Code sub-agents with Task tool
```

## ðŸ”„ Who Can Create Who?

```
User
 â””â”€> Claude-Flow (via commands)
      â””â”€> Pantheon Plugin
           â””â”€> Zeus.js (always first god)
                â”œâ”€> [Simple path] Other god.js files directly
                â””â”€> [Complex path] Zeus AI agent
                     â””â”€> Other gods via Task tool
                          â””â”€> Those gods can create more agents!
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Points - Super Simple

### 1. **Zeus.js ALWAYS runs first**
   - It's JavaScript code
   - It analyzes complexity
   - It decides: "Should I use AI?"

### 2. **Simple Tasks (Score â‰¤ 5)**
   ```
   Zeus.js â†’ Directly calls â†’ Other .js files
   (No AI agents created)
   ```

### 3. **Complex Tasks (Score > 5)**
   ```
   Zeus.js â†’ Creates â†’ Zeus AI â†’ Uses Task â†’ Creates other gods
   (AI agents everywhere!)
   ```

### 4. **The Task Tool**
   - Only available to AI agents (not .js files)
   - When AI agent calls Task("name", "job", "god")
   - Claude-Flow creates that god

## ðŸŽ¬ Real Example: Step by Step

```
SCENE 1: User Request
User: "Build a chat app"

SCENE 2: Claude-Flow Responds
Claude-Flow: "Pantheon, you handle this"

SCENE 3: Zeus.js Analyzes
Zeus.js: "Hmm, chat app... real-time, auth, UI..."
         "Complexity = 7"
         "Too complex for me alone!"
         "Claude-Flow, give me an AI brain!"

SCENE 4: Zeus AI is Born
Claude-Flow: "Creating Zeus AI from zeus.md..."
Zeus AI: "I can think! I have Task tool!"
         "Let me orchestrate this..."

SCENE 5: Zeus AI Creates Team
Zeus AI: Task("Build backend", "WebSocket server", "hephaestus")
         Task("Build frontend", "Chat UI", "apollo")
         Task("Add security", "Auth system", "aegis")

SCENE 6: Gods Work Together
Hephaestus: "Building server..."
Apollo: "Creating UI..."
Aegis: "Adding security..."

SCENE 7: Complete!
All: "Chat app ready!"
User: "Awesome!"
```

## ðŸš¦ Decision Flow

```
Is task simple?
    â”‚
    â”œâ”€ YES â”€â”€> Zeus.js handles it
    â”‚          (might call other .js files)
    â”‚          NO AI AGENTS CREATED
    â”‚
    â””â”€ NO â”€â”€â”€> Zeus.js creates Zeus AI
               Zeus AI uses Task tool
               Task tool creates more gods
               LOTS OF AI AGENTS!
```

## ðŸ”‘ The Secret

**Every god has TWO parts:**
1. **god.js** - JavaScript brain (always exists)
2. **god.md** - AI instructions (used when needed)

**Simple tasks** only use the .js brain
**Complex tasks** activate the AI brain too!

That's why it's called **HYBRID** orchestration! ðŸŽ­
