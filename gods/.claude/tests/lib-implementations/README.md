# Library Implementations for Testing

This directory would contain JavaScript implementations of the Pantheon libraries for testing purposes.

## Why JavaScript Implementations?

The Pantheon libraries are written as markdown documentation with patterns and pseudo-code. For unit testing, we need actual JavaScript implementations that follow these patterns.

## Implementation Strategy

Each `.md` library file would have a corresponding `.js` implementation here:

```javascript
// model-generator.js
function parseFeatureText(text) {
  // Implementation based on patterns in model-generator.md
  const entities = [];
  
  // Entity detection logic
  const entityPattern = /(\w+)s?\s+(?:can|have|with)/gi;
  // ... implementation
  
  return entities;
}

function generateTypeScriptInterface(entity) {
  // Implementation based on patterns in model-generator.md
  let code = `export interface ${entity.name} {\n`;
  // ... implementation
  return code;
}

module.exports = {
  parseFeatureText,
  generateTypeScriptInterface,
  // ... other functions
};
```

## Testing Approach

1. **Pattern Validation**: Ensure implementations follow the documented patterns
2. **Example Testing**: Use examples from the .md files as test cases
3. **Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions not covered in documentation
4. **Integration**: Test how libraries work together

## Future Considerations

- These implementations could eventually become the actual runtime for Pantheon
- Could be compiled from the markdown documentation
- Might use a transpiler to convert patterns to executable code

For now, this serves as a placeholder for when full testing is implemented.
