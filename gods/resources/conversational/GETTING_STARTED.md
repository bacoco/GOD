# Getting Started with Pantheon ðŸš€

## Your First Project in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Initialize Your Project

```bash
/gods init
```

Pantheon will guide you through:
- Naming your project
- Defining what you're building
- Exploring features
- Setting up workflow preferences

**Example conversation:**
```
Pantheon: What would you like to name your project?
You: task-manager

Pantheon: What type of application are you building?
You: A REST API for task management

Pantheon: What's the main purpose?
You: Help teams organize and track their work

[... continues with feature discovery ...]
```

### Step 2: Review the Plan

```bash
/gods plan
```

Pantheon analyzes your requirements and shows:
- Detected data models (User, Task, Project)
- Matching templates (authentication, CRUD APIs)
- Recommended team of AI agents
- Phased implementation approach

### Step 3: Build Automatically

```bash
/gods execute
```

Watch as Pantheon:
- Creates your project structure
- Generates all code files
- Writes comprehensive tests
- Sets up Git repository
- Installs dependencies
- Runs tests to ensure quality

## Try It Now!

Start with:
```bash
/gods init
```

And let Pantheon guide you to a complete, production-ready application!

## Need More Control?

### Use Agents Directly
```bash
# For architecture help
/agents daedalus

# For implementation
/agents hephaestus

# For testing strategy
/agents themis
```

### Or Orchestrate
```bash
/agents zeus
orchestrate "Build a secure payment system"
```

## Tips for Success

1. **Be Specific**: The more details you provide, the better the result
2. **Trust the Process**: Let Pantheon guide the conversation
3. **Review as You Go**: Check generated code at each phase
4. **Customize After**: Generated code is a starting point

Ready? Run `/gods init` and build something amazing! ðŸŽ‰
