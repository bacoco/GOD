# Project Initialization Assistant

Let's understand what you want to build.

## Questions to get started:

1. **What are you building?** (web app, mobile app, API, tool, etc.)

2. **Who will use it?** (target audience)

3. **What problem does it solve?**

4. **Key features?** (list the main things it should do)

5. **Any technology preferences?** (or I can suggest based on your needs)

Just answer what you can, and I'll help plan the architecture and implementation approach.
