• Is there a particular feeling or experience you want users to have?

There are no wrong answers - we're exploring together.`;

Let me bring in Prometheus, our product visionary. He'll help us transform these ideas into concrete features.

${chalk.gray('...')}

${chalk.green('[Prometheus]:')} Thank you, Zeus. Hello! I'm Prometheus, and I specialize in turning visions into tangible products. I've been listening to your conversation with Zeus, and I'm excited about the possibilities.

Let's dive deeper into the user journey. When someone first encounters your ${this.context.idea}, what should happen in their first 30 seconds?`;

${chalk.gray('...')}

${chalk.yellow('[Apollo]:')} Zeus is right to call me! I'm Apollo, and I create experiences that delight. I understand you want something that not only works beautifully but feels magical. 

Tell me, what emotions do you want your users to feel when they interact with your creation?`;

${chalk.cyan('Current Activity:')}
• Zeus is reviewing the overall project strategy
• Prometheus has drafted initial feature concepts  
• Apollo is exploring design inspirations
• Hephaestus is preparing his workshop for construction

Everything is progressing smoothly. Would you like me to check on anything specific?`;

${chalk.cyan('How to Work with Us:')}

Simply tell us what you want to create:
  ${chalk.gray('/gods init "Your idea here"')}

We'll guide you through everything else. No technical knowledge needed.

${chalk.cyan('Your Divine Council:')}
• ${chalk.blue('Zeus')} - I orchestrate and guide the entire journey
• ${chalk.green('Prometheus')} - Product strategy and feature definition
• ${chalk.yellow('Apollo')} - Beautiful, intuitive design
• ${chalk.red('Hephaestus')} - Master craftsmanship in building
• ${chalk.purple('Athena')} - Strategic wisdom and analysis
• ${chalk.cyan('Themis')} - Quality and perfection
• And many more specialists!

Ready to begin? Just share your vision!`;
