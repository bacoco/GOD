# ⚠️ ACTUAL CURRENT FLOW (Without Approval)

## What Really Happens Right Now:

```
1. You: /gods-init "task management app"
2. Zeus: "Who will use this?"
3. You: "Remote teams"
4. Zeus: "Timeline?"
5. You: "2 weeks"
6. Zeus/Others: [More questions...]
7. Gods: [Would execute without asking]  ← NO APPROVAL!
```

## The Missing Piece

The system currently lacks the critical approval step. When gods are ready to build, they would just start executing without presenting a plan for your approval.

## What SHOULD Happen (Not Implemented Yet):

```
...conversation...
Zeus: "Based on our discussion, here's what we plan to build:
       - Backend: Node.js + PostgreSQL
       - Frontend: React + TypeScript
       - Timeline: 2 weeks
       Do you approve this plan?"
You: "Yes" / "No, change X"
[Only THEN spawn agents]
```

## To Implement Approval Flow

We need to add to the conversation logic:

1. A "proposal" phase after gathering requirements
2. A clear presentation of the plan
3. Wait for explicit user approval
4. Only execute/spawn agents after approval

## Current Reality

Right now, the system is purely conversational. Gods ask questions and could theoretically spawn agents, but there's no checkpoint where they present a complete plan and ask for your approval before proceeding.
