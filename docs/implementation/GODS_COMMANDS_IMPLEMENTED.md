# /gods Commands Implementation Complete

## Summary

I have successfully implemented all `/gods` commands as documented in the user guides. These commands now work within Claude Code CLI exactly as described in the documentation.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Command Handler System (`gods/lib/command-handler.js`)
- Routes `/gods` commands to appropriate handlers
- Supports all documented subcommands
- Integrates seamlessly with Claude Code CLI

### 2. Conversational Interface (`gods/lib/conversational-interface.js`)
- Natural dialogue system for each god
- Personality-driven responses
- Smooth transitions between gods
- Question/answer flow management

### 3. State Management (`gods/lib/conversation-state.js`)
- Persistent conversation state across sessions
- Project tracking and resumption
- Context preservation for natural continuity

### 4. All /gods Commands

#### `/gods init "project idea"`
- Starts conversational project setup
- Zeus greets and guides discovery
- Natural handoffs to specialist gods
- Generates project structure based on conversation

#### `/gods status`
- Shows current project status
- Displays phase, active god, and progress
- Provides contextual next steps

#### `/gods projects`
- Lists all Pantheon projects
- Shows status and phase for each
- Easy project selection for resume

#### `/gods resume [project]`
- Continues previous conversations
- Maintains full context
- Picks up exactly where left off

#### `/gods help [command]`
- General help and command list
- Detailed help for specific commands
- Introduction to the god pantheon

### 5. Project Generation (`gods/lib/project-generator.js`)
- Converts conversation results to actual code
- Intelligent project type detection
- Feature-based file generation
- Complete project scaffolding

## How It Works

1. **User runs**: `/gods init "I want to build a task tracker"`
2. **Zeus appears**: Asks discovery questions about users, features, experience
3. **Natural flow**: Based on answers, appropriate gods join (Prometheus, Apollo, etc.)
4. **Project planning**: Through conversation, requirements are gathered
5. **Code generation**: Hephaestus creates actual project files
6. **Persistence**: All state saved for later resumption

## Key Features

### Natural Language Processing
- Commands understand context and intent
- Questions adapt based on previous answers
- Smooth conversational flow

### Personality-Driven Gods
Each god has unique:
- Greeting style
- Question phrasing
- Domain expertise
- Transition patterns

### Smart Project Generation
- Detects project type from conversation
- Generates appropriate structure
- Includes feature-specific modules
- Creates working boilerplate

### State Persistence
- Full conversation history
- Project metadata
- Resume capability
- Multi-project support

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Start a new project
/gods init "I want to create a recipe sharing app"

# Check status
/gods status

# List all projects
/gods projects

# Resume work
/gods resume recipe-sharing-app

# Get help
/gods help
/gods help init
```

## Technical Integration

The implementation integrates with:
- `claude-pantheon.js` - Main entry point detects /gods commands
- `PantheonCore` - Provides god summoning capabilities
- Claude Code CLI - Natural command interface
- File system - Project generation and state persistence

## Testing

Run the test script to verify all commands:
```bash
node test-gods-commands.js
```

## Next Steps

The /gods commands are now fully functional. Users can:
1. Start projects through natural conversation
2. Have gods guide them through planning
3. Generate actual project code
4. Resume work anytime
5. Manage multiple projects

The conversational interface makes Pantheon accessible to non-technical users while maintaining the power of the underlying god orchestration system.
