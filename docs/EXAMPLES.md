# Pantheon Examples: How Gods Generate Custom AI Agents

## üèõÔ∏è The Innovation: Conversational PRD ‚Üí Custom MD Agents

Pantheon's core innovation is using conversational AI to extract requirements and generate project-specific agent configurations. Instead of using generic templates, the gods create custom MD files that define specialized AI agents based on your exact needs.

## üìã Example 1: E-Commerce Platform

### Initial Command
```bash
/gods init "I want to build an e-commerce platform with user authentication, product catalog, shopping cart, and real-time order tracking"
```

### The Conversation

**Zeus**: Welcome! An e-commerce platform - ambitious! Let me understand your vision better.
- Who are your target users? ‚Üí *"Small businesses selling handmade products"*
- What's the core feature that sets you apart? ‚Üí *"Real-time artisan-customer chat during order creation"*
- How do you envision the user experience? ‚Üí *"Simple, Instagram-like product browsing with integrated chat"*

**Apollo** (transitions in): Perfect! Let me help design the visual experience.
- What visual style appeals to your artisan market? ‚Üí *"Minimal, craft-focused, warm colors"*
- Mobile-first or desktop? ‚Üí *"Mobile-first, but responsive"*

**Prometheus**: Now let's plan the features. For MVP, I suggest:
1. Artisan authentication & profiles
2. Product catalog with image galleries  
3. Real-time chat system
4. Basic order management
5. Mobile-responsive design

### The Divine Council Meeting

After gathering requirements, Concilium convenes a planning council:

```
[Concilium]: Welcome to the Divine Planning Council!
[Concilium]: Daedalus, Hephaestus, and Apollo have joined the council.

[Daedalus]: Based on the requirements, I see several architectural approaches:
  1. Microservices with separate real-time service
  2. Monolithic with integrated WebSocket handling
  3. Event-driven architecture with message queuing

[Concilium]: Which architectural approach do you prefer? (1-3): 2

[Concilium]: The council agrees on monolithic-websocket architecture.

[Hephaestus]: For the technology stack, I recommend:
  ‚Ä¢ Backend: Node.js with Express or Fastify
  ‚Ä¢ Database: MongoDB for flexibility
  ‚Ä¢ Frontend: React with styled-components

[Concilium]: Let me summon Vulcan to discuss tool allocation...

[Vulcan]: Greetings! I manage access to the 87 divine tools.
[Vulcan]: Based on this project, I recommend dynamic tool allocation:
  ‚Ä¢ Gods will request tools as needed during development
  ‚Ä¢ You'll approve tool grants for transparency
  ‚Ä¢ This ensures gods only get tools they actually need

[Concilium]: Do you prefer dynamic tool allocation or pre-assign all tools? (dynamic/static): dynamic
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Example 3: How Tool Allocation Works

The system intelligently allocates from 87 MCP tools based on requirements:

### Feature ‚Üí Capability ‚Üí Tools Mapping

```javascript
// User says: "need authentication and real-time chat"

FeatureExtraction: {
  'authentication' ‚Üí ['security', 'auth-management', 'session-handling']
  'real-time' ‚Üí ['websocket', 'event-streaming', 'pubsub']
}

CapabilityMapping: {
  'auth-management' ‚Üí ['auth_manager', 'token_validator', 'session_handler']
  'websocket' ‚Üí ['websocket_manager', 'event_stream', 'message_router']
}

ToolOptimization: {
  maxTools: 20,  // For developer agents
  priority: ['auth_manager', 'websocket_manager', ...],
  removed: ['redundant_tools']
}
```

## üéØ Example 4: Agent Composition Strategies

### Hybrid Composition (Most Common)
```javascript
// For Zeus orchestrator
baseAgents: ['orchestrator-task', 'sparc-coordinator', 'hierarchical-coordinator']
strategy: 'hybrid'

Result: {
  capabilities: union(all_capabilities) + deduplication,
  tools: optimized_selection(all_tools),
  patterns: intelligent_merge(all_patterns)
}
```

### Overlay Composition
```javascript
// For specialized agents
baseAgent: 'backend-dev'
overlays: ['realtime-developer', 'auth-specialist']
strategy: 'overlay'

Result: baseAgent + additional_capabilities + additional_tools
```

## üöÄ Example 5: Complete Project Generation

### Social Media Dashboard
```bash
/gods init "Social media dashboard that aggregates posts from multiple platforms with sentiment analysis"
```

### Generated Files Structure
```
claude-flow/.claude/agents/projects/social-dashboard-001/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ zeus-social-orchestrator.md         # Orchestration + API integration
