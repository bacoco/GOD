# 🏛️ Conversation Phases & Meeting Flow

## Phase 1: Discovery Chat - When Does It End?

### Signs That Discovery Is Complete:

1. **Zeus's Verbal Cues**:
```
Zeus: "Excellent! I now have a clear vision of your project. Let me summon the specialists..."
Zeus: "The divine plan is taking shape! Time to bring in the team..."
Zeus: "I understand your needs perfectly. Let's convene the gods..."
```

2. **Key Information Gathered**:
- ✅ Users identified
- ✅ Timeline established  
- ✅ Core features defined
- ✅ Technical constraints known
- ✅ Budget/resource limits understood

3. **Automatic Triggers**:
```javascript
// Inside Pantheon's logic
if (hasUserInfo && hasTimeline && hasFeatures) {
  zeus.initiateTransition("Let's bring in the specialists!");
}
```

## Phase Transitions

### 🗣️ Phase 1 → 2: Discovery to Planning
```
You: "We need it in 2 weeks with user auth and real-time updates"
Zeus: "Perfect! A Lightning Strike approach with real-time features. 
      I'm summoning Hephaestus for the backend and Apollo for the UI..."
      
[TRANSITION HAPPENING NOW]
```

### 🤝 Phase 2 → 3: Planning to Execution
```
Hephaestus: "I'll build REST APIs with WebSockets"
Apollo: "I'll create an intuitive React interface"
Zeus: "Excellent! The plan is set. Gods, create your agents!"

[EXECUTION BEGINS]
```

## Meeting Types & How They Work

### 1. Natural Flow Meetings (Most Common)

**Where**: Right in your Claude chat
**How**: Automatic based on conversation

```
You: "I need help with the user interface"
Zeus: "Let me bring in Apollo..."

Apollo: *A radiant light fills the room*
        "I heard you need UI guidance! Tell me about your users' workflow..."
        
You: "They need drag-and-drop task management"
Apollo: "Beautiful! I envision a Kanban board with smooth animations..."
```

### 2. Divine Council Meetings (Formal)

**Trigger**: `/gods-council` or when Zeus needs group consensus
**Where**: Special "council mode" in chat

```
You: /gods-council
Topic: "Should we use microservices or monolith?"

Concilium: *Strikes gavel* "Divine Council convened!"

Present: Daedalus, Hephaestus, Athena, Zeus

Daedalus: "For a 2-week MVP, monolith is faster..."
Hephaestus: "Agreed, but with clean architecture for future splitting..."
Athena: "I calculate 40% faster delivery with monolith..."
Zeus: "The council has spoken! Monolith it is!"
```

### 3. Specialist Summoning

**Trigger**: Specific technical questions
**Where**: Inline in your conversation

```
You: "How should we handle authentication?"
Zeus: "Ah, a security matter! *Thunder rumbles*
      Aegis! Your expertise is needed!"

Aegis: *Shimmering shield appears*
       "JWT with refresh tokens and rate limiting. Let me explain..."
```

## How Long Do Phases Last?

### Discovery Phase (5-15 messages)
```
Short Project: "Todo app" → 5-6 messages
Medium Project: "E-commerce site" → 10-12 messages  
Complex Project: "Banking platform" → 15-20 messages
```

### Planning Phase (10-20 messages)
- Each god contributes 2-3 messages
- 3-5 gods typically involved
- Council meetings add 5-10 messages

### Execution Phase (Automatic)
- Gods announce agent creation
- You see: "Creating specialized agents..."
- Then: Progress updates as code generates

## Conversation Control Commands

### Speed Things Up:
```
You: "I have all requirements documented. Here they are: [paste requirements]"
Zeus: "Excellent! Let me immediately convene the team..."
```

### Request Transition:
```
You: "I think we have enough info. Can we start building?"
Zeus: "Indeed! Let me summon the builders..."
```

### Go Deeper:
```
You: "Wait, let's discuss the authentication more"
Zeus: "Of course! Let me summon Aegis for security details..."
```

## Tips for Efficient Meetings

### 1. **Be Specific Early**:
```
Good: "E-commerce for handmade crafts, 100 sellers, need in 1 month"
Less Good: "I want to sell stuff online"
```

### 2. **Use Requirements Docs**:
```
You: "Here's my PRD: [paste document]"
Zeus: "Excellent! I can see you need... Let me summon the team immediately!"
```

### 3. **Ask for Transitions**:
```
You: "Can we move to technical planning now?"
Zeus: "Absolutely! *Summons technical gods*"
```

### 4. **Request Specific Gods**:
```
You: "I need Apollo's input on the user experience"
Zeus: "Apollo! Your artistic vision is needed!"
```

## The Power of Natural Conversation

The beauty of Pantheon is that meetings feel natural:
- No rigid forms to fill
- No specific commands needed (except /gods-init)
- Gods understand context and hand off naturally
- You can interrupt, ask questions, change direction

It's like having a real team meeting where everyone understands your vision!
