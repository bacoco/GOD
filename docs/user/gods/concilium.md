# Concilium Meeting Room Guide

## Overview

Concilium is the Divine Council Facilitator who brings gods and mortals together in structured, productive meetings. Unlike traditional god interactions where you communicate one-on-one, Concilium creates meeting rooms where multiple gods collaborate with you to solve problems, make decisions, and share knowledge.
