- Who will use it?
- What problem does it solve?
- Any specific requirements?

### 3. Iterate Naturally
- Start simple
- Add features through conversation
- The gods remember your previous discussions

## Common Scenarios

```

### Continuing Work
```
/gods resume
[Zeus]: Welcome back! Ready to continue working on your ticketing system?
```

### Getting Specific Help
During conversation, you can ask for specific expertise:
- "Can Apollo show me some design options?"
- "What security considerations should we address?"
- "How should we structure the database?"

## Integration with Your Workflow

### Planning Phase
Use /gods init to explore and plan your project through conversation.

### During Development
Resume conversations to refine features or get guidance on implementation.

### Review and Enhancement
The gods can help review your progress and suggest improvements.

## Next Steps

2. Have a natural conversation about what you want to build
3. Watch as the gods create your project structure and initial code
4. Continue the conversation anytime with `/gods resume`
