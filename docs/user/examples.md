# Pantheon Examples

## Quick Start Example

```
/gods init "I need a website for my bakery"
```

The conversation begins:
```
[Zeus]: Greetings! I am Zeus, orchestrator of the Pantheon. I need 
a website for my bakery - what an intriguing vision! To ensure we create 
exactly what you imagine, I'd like to understand a few things:

• Who do you envision as the primary users of this?
• What single feature would make this indispensable?
• Is there a particular feeling or experience you want users to have?

You: Our local customers who want to see daily specials and place orders

[Zeus]: Perfect! I can see this requires both beautiful presentation 
and smooth functionality. Let me bring in Prometheus to help define 
these features in detail...

[Prometheus]: Based on what you discussed with Zeus, I'm thinking about 
online ordering, daily specials display, and customer accounts. What 
feature would make your bakery website stand out?
```

## Real-time Chat Application

```
/gods init "Create a real-time chat app with video calls"
```

The gods will collaborate:
- **Zeus**: Orchestrates the overall project
- **Daedalus**: Designs the system architecture
- **Hephaestus**: Builds the backend infrastructure
- **Apollo**: Creates the user interface
- **Hermes**: Sets up real-time communication
- **Aegis**: Ensures security and privacy

## AI-Powered Tool

```
/gods init "Build an AI tool for analyzing code quality"
```

Watch as the gods work together:
- Architecture planning with Daedalus
- AI integration with specialized expertise
- Frontend development with Apollo
- Quality assurance with Themis

## Inter-God Collaboration Example

When building complex systems, gods communicate naturally:

```
[Daedalus]: I've designed the architecture with microservices. 
The API gateway will handle authentication.

[Hephaestus]: Perfect! I'll implement the services with that in mind. 
Apollo, the API endpoints will be ready at /api/v1/*.

[Apollo]: Excellent. I'll design the UI to work with those endpoints. 
Should we implement real-time updates?

[Hermes]: I can handle the WebSocket connections for real-time features.
```

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific About Your Vision**
   - Good: "Recipe app where users can adjust serving sizes"
   - Better: "Recipe app for home cooks that automatically adjusts ingredients when changing serving sizes"

2. **Share Your Constraints**
   - "Needs to work on mobile devices"
   - "Must integrate with existing systems"
   - "Should handle 10,000 users"

3. **Describe the Experience**
   - "Clean and minimalist like Medium"
   - "Playful and engaging like Duolingo"
   - "Professional like LinkedIn"

## Common Patterns

### MVP First
The gods often suggest starting with core features:
```
[Prometheus]: For your marketplace, I suggest we start with:
1. User registration and profiles
2. Product listings with images
3. Basic search and filters
4. Simple checkout process

We can add advanced features like recommendations later.
```

### Iterative Development
You can always enhance your project:
```
/gods resume "marketplace"

[Zeus]: Welcome back! Your marketplace foundation is solid. 
What would you like to enhance or add next?
```

### Technical Decisions
The gods explain their choices:
```
[Daedalus]: I recommend using PostgreSQL for your data because:
- Your product relationships are complex
- You need reliable transactions
- It scales well with your growth plans
```
