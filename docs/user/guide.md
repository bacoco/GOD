# Working with Your Divine AI Council

Welcome to Pantheon, where you don't write code or manage technical details. Instead, you collaborate with a council of specialized AI gods who transform your ideas into reality through natural conversation.

## Getting Started

To begin any project, simply type in Claude Code CLI:

```
/gods init "I want to build a recipe sharing platform"
```

That's it. Zeus will greet you and guide you through everything else.

## Your Journey with the Gods

### The First Meeting

When you share your idea, Zeus appears as your primary guide:

> **[Zeus]:** Greetings! I am Zeus, orchestrator of the Pantheon. A recipe sharing platform is a wonderful vision. To ensure we create exactly what you imagine, let me understand your needs better:
> 
> - Who will use this platform? Home cooks, professional chefs, or both?
> - What makes your platform unique compared to existing recipe sites?
> - Do you envision this as a website, mobile app, or both?

Zeus doesn't expect perfect answers. He's here to help you discover what you truly want to build.

### The Natural Flow

As your conversation progresses, Zeus identifies which specialist you need:

> **[Zeus]:** Excellent insights! Now that I understand your vision of a community-driven platform with video tutorials, I'll bring in Prometheus, our product strategist. He'll help define the specific features your users will love.
> 
> *A moment passes...*
> 
> **[Prometheus]:** Thank you, Zeus. Hello! I'm Prometheus, and I specialize in turning visions into concrete features. Based on what you discussed with Zeus, I'm thinking about user profiles, recipe collections, and interactive cooking modes. What feature would make your platform indispensable to users?

### Collaborative Creation

Each god brings their expertise naturally:

- **Prometheus** helps you define what your project does
- **Apollo** creates beautiful, intuitive designs  
- **Athena** analyzes user needs and market opportunities
- **Daedalus** ensures everything is built on solid foundations
- **Hephaestus** brings your vision to life with masterful craftsmanship

You never manage these transitions. The gods handle everything.

## Simple Commands

While most of your interaction is conversational, a few simple commands help you navigate:

### Starting Fresh
```
/gods init "Your project idea"
```
Begin a new project with your vision.

### Checking Progress
```
/gods status
```
See what the gods are currently working on.

### Listing Projects
```
/gods projects
```
View all projects the council is managing for you.

### Getting Help
```
/gods help
/gods help init    # Get help for a specific command
```
The gods explain how they can assist you.

### Resuming Work
```
/gods resume              # Resume most recent project
/gods resume project-name # Resume specific project
```
Continue a previous conversation where you left off.

## Meet Your Divine Council

### Zeus - The Orchestrator
Your primary guide who understands the big picture and coordinates the entire council. He ensures the right god helps you at the right time.

### Prometheus - The Product Visionary  
Transforms your ideas into concrete features and user experiences. He thinks about what users need and how they'll interact with your creation.

### Apollo - The Design Maestro
Creates beautiful, intuitive interfaces that delight users. He ensures your project not only works well but feels wonderful to use.

### Athena - The Strategic Analyst
Provides wisdom about users, markets, and opportunities. She helps you make informed decisions based on deep insights.

### Daedalus - The Master Architect
Designs the foundational structure of your project. He ensures everything is built to last and can grow with your needs.

### Hephaestus - The Master Builder
Transforms designs and plans into working reality. He crafts your project with skill and attention to detail.

### Themis - The Quality Guardian
Ensures everything works perfectly and meets the highest standards. She tests every aspect to guarantee excellence.

### Hermes - The Process Guide

### Concilium - The Collaboration Facilitator
Brings gods and humans together for important decisions. He creates space for productive group discussions.

## Natural Conversations

The gods speak naturally and remember your entire conversation:

> **You:** I'm worried about users uploading inappropriate content.
> 
> **[Athena]:** A valid concern. Let me bring in Aegis, our security specialist, to discuss content moderation strategies.
> 
> **[Aegis]:** Thank you, Athena. For user-generated content, I recommend a three-layer approach: automated scanning, community reporting, and human review for edge cases. Shall we discuss what types of content you want to prevent?

## What Happens Behind the Scenes

While you converse naturally with the gods, they handle all technical complexities:

- Prometheus creates detailed project plans
- Apollo produces design specifications  
- Daedalus develops architectural blueprints
- Hephaestus writes and tests code
- Themis ensures quality standards

You never see this work directly. Instead, the gods present results in ways you understand:

> **[Apollo]:** I've created three design concepts for your homepage. Would you like me to describe how each one welcomes users differently?

## Tips for Success

### Be Natural
Speak as you would to expert consultants. The gods understand context and nuance.

### Ask Questions  
The gods love to explain and explore options with you.

### Trust the Process
You don't need to know which god to talk to or when. Zeus orchestrates everything.

### Iterate Freely
Change your mind, explore alternatives, ask "what if" - the gods adapt instantly.

## Your Next Step

Ready to begin? Simply share your idea:

```
/gods init "Your vision here"
```

The council awaits your command.
