## The Three Key Moments

### 1️⃣ "Chat Phase Ends" Signal:
```
Zeus: "I have everything I need! Time to build..."
```

### 2️⃣ "Gods Are Planning" Signal:
```
Multiple gods discussing: "I'll handle X..." "I'll build Y..."
```

### 3️⃣ "Building Begins" Signal:
```
Gods: "Creating specialized agents now..."
[Then you wait while code generates]
```

## Pro Tips

### Get to Building Faster:
1. **Prepare a list** of requirements before starting
2. **Answer concisely** - Zeus needs: Users, Timeline, Features
3. **Say "That's all"** when you've shared everything

### Example Speed Run:
```
You: /gods-init "Task app for remote teams. 
     Users: 5-20 people per team.
     Timeline: 2 week MVP.
     Features: Kanban board, real-time updates, user auth.
     Tech: Modern web stack.
     That's all the requirements!"

Zeus: "Comprehensive brief! Summoning the builders immediately..."
[Skips straight to planning]
```

## Remember: It's Just a Conversation!

- No special commands needed after /gods-init
- Gods understand natural language
- You can interrupt anytime
- Ask questions freely
- Change direction if needed

The gods are having a real conversation with you - when they understand your vision, they'll naturally move to building it!
