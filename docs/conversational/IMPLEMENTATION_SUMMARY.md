## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Natural Conversations
```javascript
const zeus = await pantheon.summon('zeus');
const conversation = await zeus.converseAbout('Build a web app');

// Natural dialogue
const response = await conversation.ask('It needs user authentication');
```

### 2. Smooth Multi-God Handoffs
```javascript
// Zeus hands off to Prometheus
await zeus.handoffConversation(prometheus, session, 'requirements gathering');

// Natural transition with continuity
// [Zeus]: I've captured the vision. Let me hand you to Prometheus for requirements.
// [Prometheus]: Thank you, Zeus. Let's define the specific features...
```

### 3. Comprehensive State Management
- Version-controlled updates
- Conflict resolution
- Role-based context filtering
- Full audit trail

### 4. Professional Debugging
- Trace IDs for every operation
- Comprehensive logging
- Debug dashboard
- Performance monitoring

### 5. Graceful Recovery
- Multiple fallback strategies
- User-friendly error handling
- Session recovery
- Automatic cleanup
